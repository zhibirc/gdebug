Dimensions of good logs:

- context
- purpose
    - debugging
    - UX
- importance
    - actions
- format
    - scannable
    - parsable

It's may be useful to add readable data and time before actual log message (for example, if we use logging for users log-in). [!](can be realized with tunable prefixes in config: date/time, emoticon, something...)
Objects should be in readable form (not "[object Object]") in any case.
An example of context is IP address and ID in log when user signs in.

Example scheme:

Name: "tracing"
Goal: debugging
Content: state changes
Audience: devs

Name: "event"
Goal: analytics
Content: actions and exceptions
Audience: admins/product owners/devs

Name: "progress"
Goal: UX
Content: percentage/errors, RUOK?
Audience: users

Name: "audit/result"
Goal: verification of behaviour
Content: summaries
Audience: compliance/business


Logging golden rules (depends on the context):

- remember the reader
- no personal data
- answer the questions!

--------------- OTHER IDEAS ----------------

- add timestamps
- add log levels for different logging ways (for example, for suppressing all logs but errors)
